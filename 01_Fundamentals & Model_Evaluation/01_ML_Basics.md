Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that applies
mathematics to large datasets to find trends and patterns while
mapping inputs and outputs.

(Supervised) Machine Learning techniques automatically learn a
model of the relationship between a set of descriptive features
and a target feature from a set of historical examples
