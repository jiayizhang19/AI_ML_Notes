### Definition of the Agent
The agent is an AI model capable of **reasonig, planning, and interacting with its environment (acting)**. Think of the Agent as having two main parts:
1. **The Brain (AI model)**: Handles **reasoning and planning**, it decides which actions to take based on the situation.
    - LLMs are the most common type of AI models for this purpose.
    - LLMs are a key component of AI Agents, providing the foundation for **understanding and generating human language**. 
    - The input sequence you provide an LLM is called a prompt. Careful design of the prompt makes it easier to guide the generation of the LLM toward the desired output.
2. **The Body (Capabilities and Tools)**: Represents everything the Agent is equipped to do. The scope of possible **actions** depends on what the agent has been equipped with.  

An agent can perform any task we implement via **Tools** to complete **Actions**. (Actions are not the same as Tools. An action, for instance, can involve the use of multiple Tools to complete.)
